    "Given the thresholded gradient image computed in the previous exercise, we will now\n",
    "delineate the ridge of a mountain using Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm. Roughly\n",
    "speaking, starting from an initial node, this algorithm looks around the neighboring\n",
    "pixels and chooses the pixel with the shortest distance to the current pixel as the next\n",
    "element of the path. Particularly, in this example, we will find the shortest paths from a\n",
    "starting pixel to all the other pixels in the image. </br>\n",
    "The distance of a pixel to a neighboring one can be defined by a cost value for the edge\n",
    "connecting these two pixels. For this particular problem, we will define the cost of the\n",
    "edge to pixel (i, j) from any of its 4-neighbors as ```cost(i,j) = C - thresholdedGrad(i, j)```,\n",
    "where C is a constant and thresholdedGrad(i,j) is the value of the thresholded\n",
    "gradient image at pixel (i, j). With such definition of cost, the algorithm will assign\n",
    "low cost values to high gradient regions, which are typically the regions in the image\n",
    "that belong to the ridges of the mountain, and therefore will choose pixels belonging\n",
    "to mountain ridges as the next element in the shortest path. In the end, this would\n",
    "effectively delineate the ridge of the mountain.\n",
    "In particular, the steps of the algorithm can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "1. Assign to every pixel a distance value: zero for the initial pixel and infinity for all\n",
    "other pixels.\n",
    "2. Set the initial pixel as current and mark it visited. All the other pixels are initially\n",
    "unvisited. Create a set of all the visited pixels called the visited set (e.g., a binary\n",
    "matrix of 1’s for visited pixels and 0’s for unvisited pixels).\n",
    "3. For the current pixel, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their\n",
    "distances. Use the edge cost defined above to measure the distance between a\n",
    "pixel and its neighboring one. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to\n",
    "the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current\n",
    "pixel is marked with a distance of 15, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor has value 2, then the distance between them will be 15 + 2 = 17. If the neighbor\n",
    "was previously marked with a distance greater than 17 then change it to 17 and\n",
    "update the previous pixel position. Otherwise, keep the current value.\n",
    "4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current pixel, mark the\n",
    "current node as visited. A visited pixel will never be checked again.\n",
    "5. Select the unvisited pixel that is marked with the smallest distance, set it as the\n",
    "new \"current pixel\", and go back to step 3.\n",
    "The algorithm will terminate when all the pixels in the image are visited."
